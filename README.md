# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
Run these commands use node Liri:

- node liri my-tweets <twitter username here>
- node liri spotify-this-song <song name here>
- node liri movie-this <movie name here>
- node liri.js do-what-it-says (this will read back the log.txt file)
